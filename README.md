# notifications-antivirus

Reads jobs from a queue, using the supplied filename to fetch files from an S3 bucket, and ClamAV to scan them. Sends the scan status back by creating a new job to update the notification status.

## Setting up

### Docker container

This app uses dependencies that are difficult to install locally. In order to make local development easy, we run app commands through a Docker container. Run the following to set this up:

```shell
make bootstrap-with-docker
```

Because the container caches things like Python packages, you will need to run this again if you change things like "requirements.txt".

### AWS credentials

To run the app you will need appropriate AWS credentials. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-manuals/wiki/aws-accounts#set-up-local-development) for more details.

### uv

We use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python dependency management. Follow the [install instructions](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) or run:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### `environment.sh`

In the root directory of the application, run:

```
echo "
export NOTIFICATION_QUEUE_PREFIX='YOUR_OWN_PREFIX'
"> environment.sh
```

Things to change:

- Replace YOUR_OWN_PREFIX with local_dev_\<first name\> (to match other apps).

##  To run the application

```
# install dependencies, etc.
make bootstrap

# run the web app
make run-flask-with-docker

# run the background tasks
make run-celery-with-docker
```

##  To test the application

```
# install dependencies, etc.
make bootstrap

make test-with-docker
```

If you need to run a specific command, such as a single test, you can use the `run_with_docker.sh` script. This is what `test` and other `make` rules use.

```shell
./scripts/run_with_docker.sh pytest tests/some_specific_test.py
```
